# My Java Selenium Framework ðŸ˜Š

## Welcome to my Selenium Framework! 
This is my go-to solution for efficient web application testing. With this framework, I've focused on providing a comprehensive set of features to make testing a breeze.

Key Features:
- Parallel Execution: I've implemented parallel execution to speed up testing, making the most of my resources and reducing overall execution time.
- Allure Reports: Detailed Allure reports are generated automatically, giving me valuable insights into test results and helping me analyze and report effectively.
- UI and API Testing: Whether it's UI or API testing, my framework has got it covered. I can ensure thorough testing across different layers of my application.
- TestNG and JUnit 5 Integration: Seamless integration with TestNG and JUnit 5 provides me with flexibility and compatibility, allowing me to choose the testing framework that suits my needs.
- Modular Structure: I've designed the framework with a modular structure, making maintenance, scalability, and reusability of test cases and components a breeze.
- Configuration Management: Robust configuration management ensures that I can easily handle various test environment configurations, enhancing the reliability and consistency of my tests.
- Logging and Reporting: Detailed logging and reporting mechanisms help me capture crucial test execution details, errors, and exceptions, enabling thorough analysis and debugging.
- Jenkins Integration: The tests are seamlessly integrated with Jenkins, allowing for continuous integration and delivery. Jenkins pulls the tests directly from this repository, ensuring that the latest tests are always executed.
