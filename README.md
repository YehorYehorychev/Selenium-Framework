# Welcome to my Selenium Framework! 😊
This is my go-to solution for efficient web application testing. With this framework, I've focused on providing a comprehensive set of features to make testing a breeze.

Key Features:
- Parallel Execution: I've implemented parallel execution to speed up testing, making the most of my resources and reducing overall execution time.
- Allure Reports: Detailed Allure reports are generated automatically, giving me valuable insights into test results and helping me analyze and report effectively.
- UI and API Testing: Whether it's UI or API testing, my framework has got it covered. I can ensure thorough testing across different layers of my application.
- TestNG and JUnit 5 Integration: Seamless integration with TestNG and JUnit 5 provides me with flexibility and compatibility, allowing me to choose the testing framework that suits my needs.
- Modular Structure: I've designed the framework with a modular structure, making maintenance, scalability, and reusability of test cases and components a breeze.
- Configuration Management: Robust configuration management ensures that I can easily handle various test environment configurations, enhancing the reliability and consistency of my tests.
- Logging and Reporting: Detailed logging and reporting mechanisms help me capture crucial test execution details, errors, and exceptions, enabling thorough analysis and debugging.
- Jenkins Integration: The tests are seamlessly integrated with Jenkins, allowing for continuous integration and delivery. Jenkins pulls the tests directly from this repository, ensuring that the latest tests are always executed.

## Getting Started:
To get started with my Selenium Framework, follow these simple steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Set up your favorite IDE with the necessary dependencies.
- Configure the framework according to your project requirements, including test environment settings and browser configurations.
- Start writing your test scripts using the provided templates and utilities.
- Execute your tests locally or integrate them into your CI/CD pipeline for automated testing using Jenkins.
With these features, my Java Selenium Framework provides a robust and efficient solution for all your web application testing needs.

## Running Tests:
You can run the tests in my framework using different methods:

## Using Maven:
You can execute the tests using Maven with the following command:

`mvn clean test -Dbrowser=BROWSERNAME`
Replace BROWSERNAME with **CHROME**, **FIREFOX**, or **EDGE** (case sensitive) to specify the browser for the test execution. For example:

`mvn clean test -Dbrowser=CHROME`

## Using TestNG XML:
You can also run the tests by specifying the TestNG XML file. This method allows you to define test configurations and suites in an XML file.

`Right-click on the testng.xml file.`

Select Run '...\testng.xml' from the context menu.
